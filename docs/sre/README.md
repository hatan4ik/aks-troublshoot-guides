## Observability at Scale
Implementing robust monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to gain deep insights into cluster and application health.
-   [**Guide:** Observability at Scale](./observability-at-scale.md)

## Incident Response and Management
Establishing clear processes and tools for detecting, responding to, and resolving production incidents efficiently.
-   [**Guide:** Emergency Response (Root)](../emergency-response.md)

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Error Budgets
Defining and tracking key reliability metrics to balance innovation with stability.

## Capacity Planning and Performance Optimization
Proactively managing cluster resources and optimizing workload performance to prevent issues.

## Post-Mortems and Learning from Failures
Conducting blameless post-mortems to identify root causes and implement preventative measures.
-   [**Template:** Post-Mortem Template](../../templates/post-mortem-template.md)

## Automation for Reliability
Developing automated solutions for diagnostics, remediation, and proactive maintenance to reduce toil.
